# sudoku_recursion
Another way to solve sudoku, using recursion (easier and little bit faster).

It finds all solution, it's faster and easier to implement.
There are only two functions:
- possibile: checks if digit "n" could fill a given square
- solve: it's defined recursively and allow to perform backtracking in a smart and quick way.
